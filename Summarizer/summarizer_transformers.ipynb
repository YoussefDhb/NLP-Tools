    "- Used **pre-trained encoder–decoder models** (BART/T5/Pegasus) for **abstractive** summarization.\n",
    "- Implemented **long-text handling** via truncation and a **chunk-and-merge** strategy.\n",
    "- Evaluated with **ROUGE-1/2/L** (F1) using `rouge-score`.\n",
    "- Implemented **extractive TextRank** and compared outputs qualitatively.\n",
    "- Included a **fine-tuning** template with `Trainer` for your custom dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next steps:**\n",
    "- Tune generation params (`num_beams`, `min_length`, `length_penalty`) per model.\n",
    "- Add coverage penalty or nucleus sampling for diverse summaries.\n",
    "- For long documents, summarize-by-sections then re-summarize the summaries.\n",
    "- Use `enforce_max_length=False` and careful chunking for models with smaller context.\n"
