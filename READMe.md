# NLP Tools

All-in-one workspace for common NLP tasks: Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition, Question Answering, Abstractive Summarization, and Resume Screening. The repo includes ready-to-run Jupyter notebooks and Streamlit apps.

## What’s inside

- Sentiment Analysis — classic ML (scikit-learn) pipeline and notebook.
- Named Entity Recognition — spaCy-based NER with rule-based additions.
- Question Answering — Transformers QA models over custom context.
- Summarizer — BART/T5 style abstractive summarization with optional chunking and a Streamlit app.
- Resume Screening — Embedding-based ranking of resumes vs. job descriptions, skill extraction, and a Streamlit app.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11, PowerShell 5.1+ (or Windows Terminal)
- Python 3.9–3.11 recommended
- Optional GPU: CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU + appropriate PyTorch build

Core Python packages used across tools:

- streamlit, transformers, sentence-transformers, torch
- spacy (and model en_core_web_sm), pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- pdfplumber, python-docx (file parsing)

You can install everything globally or in a virtual environment.


## Features (all bonuses included)

- Named Entity Recognition
	- Loads CoNLL2003-style files or a CSV of articles.
    - Builds a **rule-based** `EntityRuler` with common patterns.
    - Runs **model-based** NER using two spaCy models (auto-detected).
    - Highlights & categorizes entities in tables and with **displaCy** visualization.
    - Evaluates entity extraction against CoNLL gold spans (precision, recall, F1).
    - Compares model outputs and shows entity counts.es.

- Sentiment Analysis
    - Clean & preprocess text (lowercasing, URL/punctuation/number removal, stopwords)
    - Optional **lemmatization** (spaCy preferred; fallback to NLTK WordNet)
    - Text → **TF‑IDF** (default) or **CountVectorizer**
    - Train **Logistic Regression** and **Multinomial Naive Bayes** (compare accuracy)
    - **Evaluation**: accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix
    - **Visualizations**: most frequent **positive/negative** words (bar charts) + **word clouds**

- Question Answering
	- Loading SQuAD v1.1-style data or a CSV with `context`, `question`, `answers` columns.  
    - Running inference with pretrained QA models to extract answer spans.  
    - Evaluating using Exact Match (EM) and F1 (token-level) metrics.  
    - Comparing two models side-by-side.  
    - Fine-tuning a model on your dataset using the Hugging Face `Trainer`.  
    - Simple interactive interfaces: CLI and Streamlit examples.

- Summarization
    - Load **CNN/DailyMail** (Kaggle) or your own CSV (`text`, `summary`)
    - **Abstractive** summarization with Hugging Face Transformers (BART/T5/Pegasus; picks the first two available)
    - Long-text handling: **truncate** to model limits and optional **chunk-and-merge** pipeline
    - **ROUGE** evaluation (ROUGE-1/2/L via `rouge-score`)
    - **Extractive** summarization with **TextRank** (pure Python: TF-IDF + cosine + PageRank)
    - **Fine-tuning** a pre-trained summarizer on a custom dataset (minimal, Trainer API)

- Resume Screening
    - Parse resumes from **.pdf**, **.docx**, **.txt** files.
    - Preprocess text and extract entities/skills (spaCy + PhraseMatcher + regex).
    - Compute embeddings with **sentence-transformers** and rank resumes by **cosine similarity** to job descriptions.
    - Provide interpretable justifications: matched skills, years of experience, and top sentences that matched.
    - Optional classifier (train on labeled matches if you have them).
    - Simple **Streamlit** front-end example to upload a resume and view top matches.
    - Save results and export top candidates.


## Final Thoughts

This project was developed during an internship within **Elevvo Pathways**.
